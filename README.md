# INF236 Project 1
Contains:

1D Cellular Automata
	-	Sequential
	-	Parallel

2D Cellular Automata
	-	Sequential
	-	Parallel

# Running the parallel programs:
1. Go to /tools.
2. Run ./generateinput.sh. This will generate input for the two programs.
3. Save the rules in a folder /rules
4. Run ./runall.sh. This will run all combinations of processes and input files for both 1D and 2D.
5. Output times in /output. You will need to comment out printing of the final board in 2D for the output to make sense.
